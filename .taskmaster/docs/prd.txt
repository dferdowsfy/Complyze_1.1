# Overview
This project involves removing the "Prompt Optimizer" button from the Complyze application's user interface while maintaining the integrity of the application's functionality. The goal is to simplify the user interface by consolidating UI elements and ensuring a clean removal of unused components.

# Core Features
1. UI Modification
- Remove the "Prompt Optimizer" button from the PromptJourney.tsx component
- Ensure the removal doesn't affect the layout or functionality of surrounding components
- Maintain proper styling and responsiveness

2. Code Cleanup
- Remove any unused imports related to the Prompt Optimizer
- Clean up any associated event handlers or functions
- Ensure no orphaned code remains

# User Experience
The removal of the Prompt Optimizer button should:
- Not disrupt the existing user flow
- Maintain the application's clean and intuitive interface
- Not affect other UI elements' positioning or functionality

# Technical Architecture
Components Affected:
- Primary UI Components: PromptJourney.tsx
- Potential dependencies in other components
- Associated styling and layout code

# Development Roadmap
Phase 1 - Analysis and Planning:
- Identify all occurrences of the Prompt Optimizer button
- Map dependencies and affected components
- Plan the removal strategy

Phase 2 - Implementation:
- Remove the button component
- Clean up associated code
- Adjust layout and styling as needed

Phase 3 - Testing and Validation:
- Verify UI integrity
- Test surrounding component functionality
- Ensure no regressions

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Analyze current implementation
2. Remove button and direct dependencies
3. Clean up associated code
4. Test and validate changes
5. Final review and documentation

# Risks and Mitigations
Risks:
- Potential layout disruption
- Hidden dependencies
- Regression in functionality

Mitigations:
- Thorough testing of UI layout
- Comprehensive code review
- Validation of all affected components

# Appendix
Current Implementation Location:
- Primary location: PromptJourney.tsx
- Associated files: Any imported components or utilities

Product Requirements Document: Remove Prompt Optimizer Button

Objective:
Remove the "Prompt Optimizer" button from the application while maintaining the functionality of "Insert New Prompt" and "View Audit Log" buttons.

Requirements:
