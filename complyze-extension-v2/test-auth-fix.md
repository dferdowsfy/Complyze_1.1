# üîß Complyze Extension Authentication Fix - Test Guide

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed:**

### **Problem Identified:**
- Extension showed `Login status for complyze.co: false` even when user was logged into dashboard
- Extension has its own authentication system requiring `accessToken` in Chrome storage
- No automatic sync between dashboard login and extension authentication

### **Solution Implemented:**
1. **Enhanced Login Detection**: Added fallback login detection methods for Complyze dashboard
2. **Auto Token Extraction**: Added `tryExtractAuthToken()` function to extract auth from dashboard session
3. **Background Auth Handler**: Added `set_auth_data` message handler to receive auth from content script
4. **Multiple Auth Methods**: Tries localStorage, sessionStorage, API calls, and email detection

## üß™ **Test Steps:**

### **1. Reload Extension**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Complyze" extension
3. Click the refresh/reload button üîÑ
4. ‚úÖ Extension should reload with new authentication logic

### **2. Test Dashboard Authentication**
1. Navigate to `https://complyze.co/dashboard`
2. Make sure you're logged in (you should see your email and dashboard)
3. Open Developer Tools (F12)
4. Check Console tab for Complyze messages
5. ‚úÖ Should see: `Complyze: OVERRIDE - Forcing login status to true for dashboard page`
6. ‚úÖ Should see: `Complyze: Attempting to extract auth token from dashboard session...`

### **3. Test Authentication Sync**
1. Look for console messages showing:
   - `Complyze: Found user email in page: [your-email]`
   - `Complyze: Successfully got user data from /auth/me: [user-data]`
   - `Complyze: Sending auth info to background script...`
   - `Complyze: Successfully sent auth data to background`

### **4. Test Prompt Analysis**
1. Go to ChatGPT, Claude, or another AI website
2. Type a test prompt with some sensitive info (like "My SSN is 123-45-6789")
3. ‚úÖ Should now proceed with analysis instead of showing "User not logged in"
4. ‚úÖ Should see prompt data being sent to production dashboard

### **5. Verify Dashboard Data**
1. Return to `https://complyze.co/dashboard`
2. Check if new prompt events appear in the dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Should see the test prompts you submitted

## üîç **Debug Console Messages to Look For:**

### **Successful Authentication Flow:**
```
Complyze: Platform detected: complyze.co
Complyze: OVERRIDE - Forcing login status to true for dashboard page
Complyze: Attempting to extract auth token from dashboard session...
Complyze: Found user email in page: [email]
Complyze: Successfully got user data from /auth/me: [data]
Complyze: Sending auth info to background script...
Complyze: Successfully sent auth data to background
```

### **Successful Prompt Processing:**
```
Complyze: User authenticated, proceeding with analysis
Complyze: Processing prompt analysis for: [platform]
Complyze: Successfully sent to dashboard
```

## üö® **If Still Not Working:**

### **Manual Authentication:**
1. Click the Complyze extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Use the popup to manually log in with your Complyze credentials
3. This should sync your authentication state

### **Clear Storage and Retry:**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "Details" on Complyze extension
3. Click "Extension options" 
4. Clear any stored data
5. Reload extension and retry authentication

## üìä **Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Extension detects login status correctly
- ‚úÖ Prompts are analyzed and sent to production dashboard
- ‚úÖ Dashboard populates with new prompt events  
- ‚úÖ Real-time analysis works on AI websites
- ‚úÖ Authentication persists across browser sessions
