# Complyze Desktop Agent - Recent Improvements

## Issues Fixed (Version Update)

### 1. ✅ Button Size Consistency
- **Problem**: Action buttons had inconsistent sizes
- **Solution**: Updated CSS to make all action buttons the same size (200-250px width, 50px height)
- **Files Changed**: `ui/src/App.css`

### 2. ✅ Excessive Popup Issue
- **Problem**: Too many popup notifications appearing constantly, making ChatGPT/Claude unusable
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - **Increased monitoring intervals**: 3 seconds for general monitoring, 5 seconds for input monitoring
  - **Added debouncing**: 10 seconds minimum between clipboard notifications
  - **Enhanced prompt detection**: Only process text with clear prompt indicators AND minimum 5 words
  - **Removed app launch notifications**: No more immediate popups when switching to AI apps
  - **Disabled accessibility permission popup**: No longer shows on every app launch
  - **Added processing queue**: Prevents duplicate processing of the same content
  - **Reduced auto-close timers**: 8 seconds for non-blocking, 20 seconds for blocking notifications

### 3. ✅ Improved Timing for Prompt Optimization
- **Problem**: Enhanced prompts took too long to generate, users already sent original prompt
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - **Fast risk assessment first**: Quick check for sensitive data before enhancement
  - **Background processing**: Low-risk prompts are enhanced in background to avoid delays
  - **Immediate blocking**: High-risk prompts are processed immediately with faster enhancement
  - **Debounced input monitoring**: 2-second delay to allow users to finish typing
  - **Asynchronous logging**: Logging happens in background to avoid blocking UI

### 4. ✅ Updated App Logo
- **Problem**: Requested new shield logo with no background
- **Solution**: 
  - Created Python script to generate shield with checkmark design
  - Generated all required icon sizes (16px to 1024px)
  - Updated tray icons for menu bar
  - Created .icns file for macOS compatibility
  - Used transparent background as requested

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Monitoring Logic
- **Smarter prompt detection**: Uses specific indicators like "explain", "how to", "generate", etc.
- **Minimum content requirements**: 20+ characters, 5+ words for meaningful prompts
- **Spam prevention**: 10-second cooldown between notifications
- **App switching detection**: 10-second confirmation before showing AI app notifications

### Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced monitoring frequency**: Less CPU usage, better battery life
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking operations for better UX
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup of processing queues
- **Error handling**: Silent handling of AppleScript errors

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Consistent button sizing**: All action buttons now uniform
- **Faster notifications**: Reduced auto-close timers for less intrusion
- **Better visual feedback**: Improved notification design and timing
- **Professional branding**: New shield logo across all platforms

## User Experience Changes

### Before:
- Constant popup spam when using ChatGPT/Claude
- Inconsistent button sizes
- Slow prompt optimization
- Generic logo

### After:
- Intelligent, context-aware notifications
- Clean, consistent UI design
- Fast response times for critical issues
- Professional shield branding

## Files Modified

1. **ui/src/App.css** - Button consistency and visual improvements
2. **src/main.ts** - Core monitoring logic improvements
3. **assets/** - New shield logo in all required formats
4. **RECENT-IMPROVEMENTS.md** - This documentation

## How to Test

1. **Start the app**: `npm start`
2. **Open ChatGPT or Claude desktop**: Should see minimal notifications
3. **Copy a prompt with sensitive data**: Should get immediate blocking notification
4. **Copy a regular prompt**: Should get quick, non-intrusive enhancement
5. **Check new logo**: Should see shield with checkmark in dock/tray

## Next Steps

- Monitor user feedback on notification frequency
- Fine-tune prompt detection algorithms based on usage
- Consider adding user preferences for notification sensitivity
- Implement A/B testing for different timing configurations
