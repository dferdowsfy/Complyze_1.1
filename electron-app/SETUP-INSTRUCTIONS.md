# Complyze Desktop Agent - Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. Hidden Middle Button
- The "Show Monitoring Settings" button is now hidden
- Only "Open Dashboard" and "Show Prompt Tester" buttons are visible
- Buttons are consistently sized (200-300px width, 50px height)

### 2. Enhanced AI App Detection
- Improved ChatGPT Desktop detection with multiple patterns
- Enhanced Claude Desktop detection with bundle identifiers  
- Better process matching for both apps
- More aggressive input monitoring with 3-second intervals

### 3. Always Visible Monitoring Status
- Monitored apps and websites are always displayed
- Enhanced styling with better visual hierarchy
- Hover effects and improved spacing
- Real-time status updates

### 4. OpenRouter Integration (Partial)
- Created `src/shared/openRouterService.ts` with security framework mapping
- Added NIST, OWASP, and ISO/IEC control family mappings
- Enhanced redaction analysis with severity levels
- Security insights generation (needs completion)

### 5. Updated App Logo
- New shield with checkmark design
- Transparent background as requested
- All icon sizes generated (16px to 1024px)
- macOS .icns and tray icons created

## To Complete the Setup:

### 1. Fix TypeScript Errors
The OpenRouter integration has minor TypeScript issues. Update the notification interface:

```typescript
// In main.ts, update the createNotificationWindow data parameter
securityInsights: securityInsights ?? undefined,
enhancedRedactionDetails: enhancedRedactionDetails ?? []
```

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
cd electron-app
npm start
```

### 3. Test the Improvements
1. **Open ChatGPT or Claude Desktop apps**
2. **Type a prompt with sensitive data** (like the example in your screenshot)
3. **Check for notifications** - should show enhanced insights
4. **Verify button layout** - middle button should be hidden
5. **Check monitoring status** - should always be visible

### 4. Expected Behavior
- **App Detection**: Both ChatGPT and Claude should be detected when launched
- **Input Monitoring**: Text input should trigger notifications with:
  - Optimized prompt
  - Security framework mappings (NIST, OWASP, ISO)
  - Redaction analysis by category
  - Control family recommendations
- **Enhanced Insights**: Notifications should show relevant security controls

### 5. Monitoring Configuration
The app now monitors:
- **ChatGPT Desktop**: Enhanced detection patterns
- **Claude Desktop**: Improved process matching  
- **Clipboard**: Smart prompt detection
- **Real-time Input**: 1-second response time

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Button layout fixed
- Enhanced app detection
- Always visible monitoring
- New shield logo
- Reduced notification spam
- Faster processing times

ðŸ”§ **In Progress:**
- OpenRouter security insights integration
- TypeScript error resolution
- Enhanced notification display

## Next Steps

1. Complete the TypeScript fixes
2. Test with real prompts containing sensitive data
3. Verify security framework mappings work correctly
4. Fine-tune notification timing and frequency

The core improvements are implemented and should provide the desired behavior you requested.
